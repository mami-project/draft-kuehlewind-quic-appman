1.  Introduction

   QUIC [I-D.ietf-quic-transport] is a new transport protocol currently
   under development in the IETF quic working group, focusing on support
   of semantics as needed for HTTP/2 [I-D.ietf-quic-http] such as
   stream-multiplexing to avoid head-of-line blocking.  Based on current
   deployment practices, QUIC is encapsulated in UDP.  The version of
   QUIC that is currently under development will integrate TLS 1.3
   [I-D.ietf-quic-tls] to encrypt all payload data and most control
   information.

   This document provides guidance for application developers that want
   to use the QUIC protocol without implementing it on their own.  This
   includes general guidance for application use of HTTP/2 over QUIC as
   well as the use of other application layer protocols over QUIC.  For
   specific guidance on how to integrate HTTP/2 with QUIC, see
   [I-D.ietf-quic-http].

   In the following sections we discuss specific caveats to QUIC's
   applicability, and issues that application developers must consider
   when using QUIC as a transport for their application.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are used in this
   document.  It's not shouting; when these words are capitalized, they
   have a special meaning as defined in [RFC2119].

2.  The Necessity of Fallback

   QUIC uses UDP as a substrate for userspace implementation and port
   numbers for NAT and middlebox traversal.  While there is no evidence
   of widespread, systematic disadvantage of UDP traffic compared to TCP
   in the Internet [Edeline16], somewhere between three [Trammell16] and
   five [Swett16] percent of networks simply block UDP traffic.  All
   applications running on top of QUIC must therefore either be prepared
   to accept connectivity failure on such networks, or be engineered to
   fall back to some other transport protocol.  This fallback SHOULD
   provide TLS 1.3 or equivalent cryptographic protection, if available,
   in order to keep fallback from being exploited as a downgrade attack.
   In the case of HTTP, this fallback is TLS 1.3 over TCP.

   These applications must operate, perhaps with impaired functionality,
   in the absence of features provided by QUIC not present in the
   fallback protocol.  For fallback to TLS over TCP, the most obvious
   difference is that TCP does not provide stream multiplexing and
   therefore stream multiplexing would need to be implemented in the
   application layer if needed.  Further, TCP without the TCP Fast Open
   extension does not support 0-RTT session resumption.  TCP Fast Open
   can be requested by the connection initiator but might no be
   supported by the far end or could be blocked on the network path.
   Note that there is some evidence of middleboxes blocking SYN data
   even if TFO was successfully negotiated (see [PaaschNanog]).

   Any fallback mechanism is likely to impose a degradation of
   performance; however, fallback MUST not silently violate the
   application's expectation of confidentiality or integrity of its
   payload data.

   Moreover, while encryption (in this case TLS) is inseparable
   integrated with QUIC, TLS negotiation over TCP can be blocked.  In
   case it is RECOMMENDED to abort the connection, allowing the
   application to present a suitable prompt to the user that secure
   communication is unavailable.

3.  Zero RTT: Here There Be Dragons

   QUIC provides for 0-RTT connection establishment (see section 3.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-quic-transport]).  However, data in the frames contained in
   0-RTT packets of a such a connection must be treated specially by the
   application layer.  Replay of these packets can cause the data to
   processed twice.  This is further described in
   [I-D.nottingham-httpbis-retry].

   Applications that cannot treat data that may appear in a 0-RTT
   connection establishment as idempotent MUST NOT use 0-RTT

   establishment.  For this reason the QUIC transport SHOULD provide an
   interface for the application to indicate if 0-RTT support is in
   general desired or a way to indicate if data is idempotent.

4.  Stream versus Flow Multiplexing

   QUIC's stream multiplexing feature allows applications to run
   multiple streams over a single connection, without head-of-line
   blocking between streams, associated at a point in time with a single
   five-tuple.  Streams are meaningful only to the application; since
   stream information is carried inside QUIC's encryption boundary, no
   information about the stream(s) whose frames are carried by a given
   packet is visible to the network.

   Stream multiplexing is not intended to be used for differentiating
   streams in terms of network treatment.  Application traffic requiring
   different network treatment SHOULD therefore be carried over
   different five-tuples (i.e.  multiple QUIC connections).  Given
   QUIC's ability to send application data in the first RTT of a
   connection (if a previous connection to the same host has been
   successfully established to provide the respective credentials), the
   cost for establishing another connection are extremely low.

5.  Prioritization

   Stream prioritization is not exposed to the network, nor to the
   receiver.  Prioritization can be realized by the sender and the QUIC
   transport should provide and interface for applications to prioritize
   streams [I-D.ietf-quic-transport].

   Priority handling of retransmissions may be implemented by the sender
   in the transport layer and [I-D.ietf-quic-transport] does not specify
   a specific way how this must be handled.  Currently QUIC only
   provides fully reliable stream transmission, and as such
   prioritization of retransmission is likely beneficial.  For not fully
   reliable streams priority scheduling of retransmissions over data of
   higher-priority streams might not be desired.  In this case QUIC
   could also provide an interface or derive the prioritization decision
   from the reliability level of the stream.

6.  Graceful connection closure

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: give some guidance here about the steps an
   application should take; however this is still work in progress]

7.  Information exposure and the Connection ID

   QUIC exposes some information to the network in the unencrypted part
   of the header, either before the encryption context is established,
   because the information is intended to be used by the network.  QUIC
   has a long header that is used during connection establishment and
   for other control processes, and a short header that may be used for
   data transmission in an established connection.  While the long
   header is fixed and exposes some information, the short header only
   exposes the packet number by default and may optionally expose a
   connection ID.  Given that exposing this information can have privacy
   implications, an application may indicate to not support exposure of
   certain information.

   As the connection ID is optional on the short header, an application
   that has additional information that the client is not behind a NAT
   and the server is not behind a load balancer, and therefore it is
   unlikely that the addresses will be re-bound, may indicate to the
   transport that is wishes to not expose a connection ID.

   Also see https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/514 for
   guidance on server connection ID selection.

8.  Using Server Retry for Redirection

   QUIC provide a Server Retry packet that can be send by a server in
   response to the Client Initial packet.  The server may choose a new
   connection ID in that packet and the client will retry by sending
   another Client Initial packet with the server-selected connection ID.
   This mechanism can be used to redirect a connection to a different
   server, e.g. due to performance reasons or when servers in a server
   pool are upgraded gradually, and therefore may support different
   versions of QUIC.  In this case, it is assumed that all servers
   belonging to a certain pool are served in cooperation with load
   balancers that forward the traffic based on the connection ID.  A
   server can chose the connection ID in the Server Retry packet such
   that the load balancer will redirect the next Client Initial packet
   to a different server in that pool.

9.  Use of Versions and Cryptographic Handshake

   Versioning in QUIC may change the the protocol's behavior completely,
   except for the meaning of a few header fields that have been declared
   to be fixed.  As such version of QUIC with a higher version number
   does not necessarily provide a better service, but might simply
   provide a very different service, so an application needs to be able
   to select which versions of QUIC it wants to use.

   A new version could use an encryption scheme other than TLS 1.3 or
   higher.  [I-D.ietf-quic-transport] specifies requirements for the
   cryptographic handshake as currently realized by TLS 1.3 and
   described in a separate specification [I-D.ietf-quic-tls].  This
   split is performed to enable light-weight versioning with different
   cryptographic handshakes.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

11.  Security Considerations

   See the security considerations in [I-D.ietf-quic-transport] and
   [I-D.ietf-quic-tls]; the security considerations for the underlying
   transport protocol are relevant for applications using QUIC, as well.

   Application developers should note that any fallback they use when
   QUIC cannot be used due to network blocking of UDP SHOULD guarantee
   the same security properties as QUIC; if this is not possible, the
   connection SHOULD fail to allow the application to explicitly handle
   fallback to a less-secure alternative.  See Section 2.
